# Ignore all other files except source code and .hex files
# This is a more aggressive approach, ensure all desired source files are explicitly kept if needed.
# For this project, .c, .h, .asm, Makefile, README.md, and .hex are explicitly kept by not being ignored.
# If there are other file types that should be kept, they need to be explicitly un-ignored or not included in general ignore patterns.
